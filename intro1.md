### Impediance Mismatch
1. Databases use a different model for relational data
	Table, Attributes (Columns), Tuples (records)
2. Object Oriented programming has different model
	Class, Attributes (Properties), Object

3. OOP has Has A and Is A Association
4. RDBMS have Primary Key & Foreign Keys

### ORM is Architecture/Framework used for bridge the GAP between OOP & RDBMS
